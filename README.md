Breaking ground to establish some simple rules for our now expanding group

## New joins

Effective immediately, by any admin member, or by referral from a non-admin

## New admins

Every start of February and August we randomly draw 3 people from the active new joins for the semester to be made into admins both to GitHub and Slack

## New Slack Primary Owner

Every start of February and August, we call for admins to volunteer to be the Slack primary owner for 6 months.  
That person should expect to remain active and available for the next six months.  
We draw one randomly from the pool of volunteers.
